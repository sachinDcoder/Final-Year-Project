# Movie Recommendation Engine

## Collaborative Filtering

* Collaborative Filtering simply put uses the "wisdom of the crowd" to recommend items. 
* Item based collaborative filtering uses the patterns of users who liked the same movie as me to recommend me a movie (users who liked the movie that I like, also liked these other movies).
* Recommendation based on user's input of any movie present in the dataset.

## Files

- Movie_Recommender_Notebook.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with step-by-step instructions
- Movie_Recommender_User_Input.py: Python file for allowing user's input of movie


## Dataset

The following main data source was used for this project:
- [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)

## How does it work?

### Data Pre-processing

- Dropping columns that are not required
- Merging dataframes

### Pivot Table 

![Pivot_Table](https://github.com/abhilampard/Movie_Recommendation_Engine/blob/master/Pivot_Table.PNG)

- Pivot tables give you the ability to look at data in so many different ways.
- Pivot table is created as shown in the image with Movies as rows, Users as columns and Ratings as values. 

### Cosine Similarity

- Also known as vector-based similarity, this formulation views two items and their ratings as vectors, and defines the similarity between them as the angle between these vectors:

### Recommender

- User enters his favourite movie (or the movie on the basis of which he wants the system to recommend movies)
- Based on the user's input, recommendation is made by sorting the similarities in descending order
